# Project: Enhanced Sequence

# This project contains two classes that define sequences. These sequence classes make use of templates, so that the user can specify the type of data that the sequence will contain when declaring a sequence object. Each sequence class is built using linked lists; one is built with a singly linked list, and the other is built with a doubly linked list. The member functions for each sequence class are the same as those for the original sequence class built with a dynamic array. See the documentation in the header files for a detailed description.

# This project was written using C++.
